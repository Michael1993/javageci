/**
 *- doc
 *
 * The `regex` snippet generator goes through each line of the snippet
 * and does regular expression based search and replace and it also
 * deletes certain lines that match a regular expression kill pattern.
 *
 * It can be used for example as
 *
 *      regex="replace='/a/b/' kill='abraka'"
 *
 * to replace each occurrence of `a` to `b` and the same time delete all
 * lines from the snippet that contains `abraka`.
 *
 * A real life example is:
 *
 *      regex="replace='/^\\\\s*\\\\*\\\\s?//'
 *
 * It was used in the documentation of DOCUGEN.md to include the snippet
 * defined in the JavaDoc of the class `SnippetRegex` and to remove the
 * `*` characters from the start of the line. The result is what you are
 * reading now (or you may be reading the original JavaDoc in the Java
 * file.)
 *
 * The replace configuration string should have the syntax
 *
 *     W + search string + W + replace string + W
 *
 * where `W` is just any character. It is usually `/` so that the search
 * and replace string looks like the usual vi editor search and replace.
 *
 * When we write regular expressions inside the `replace` string it is
 * interpreted as a Java string already twice. This means that the
 * escape characters used in regular expressions as well as in strings,
 * the backslash characters had to be repeated four times. This would
 * greatly decrease readability. Instead of `\s` we could write
 * `\\\\s`. (As a matter of fact it is a possibility.)
 *
 * To lessen the number of backslash characters and to avoid building
 * `\\\\\\` fences instead of coding it is possible to define a
 * character that is used instead of `\` in the regular expressions. The
 * configuration parameter is `escape` and you can write on a segment
 * line
 *
 *     regex="replace='/^~s*~*~s?//' escape='~'
 *
 * to use the tilde character instead of
 *
 *     regex="replace='/^\\\\s*\\\\*\\\\s?//'
 *
 * The recommendation is to use the tilde characters. There can only be
 * one `escape` definition in a single segment, but there can be many
 * `replace` strings and they will be executed in the order they are
 * defined.
 *
 * Note that the default escape string is a string and not only a single
 * character, but it does not really make sense to use many characters
 * when the major aim of this configuration is to shorten the regular
 * expression escape sequences.
 *
 * If you want to use the same escape string in all the snippet regex
 * modifications then you can configure it in the builder when the
 * regex snippet modifier generator object is created.
 *
 * It is to note that by default the replacements are performed on each
 * line and then the code decides if the line has to be killed or not.
 * You can reverse this order using the configuration
 *
 *     killFirst=true
 *
 * on the segment header. If there is a need for this parameter it is a
 * smell that something is overcomplicated in the use of the snippets.

     * Split up the {@code replaceString} into two parts.
     *
     * <p>The string should have the syntax {@code /search/replace/} and
     * you can just use any character instead of {@code /}. The
     * requirement is that the string starts and ends with the same
     * character and the search part ends at the second occurence of the
     * character. Thus {@code asearchareplacea} is totally legit. The
     * first and last character is {@code a}, the search string is
     * {@code se} the replacement string is {@code rchareplace}. It is
     * recommended to use {@code /} if it does not appear in the search
     * string and if {@code /} is not usable then use some other special
     * character like {@code |} or {@code :}.
     *
     * <p>The search part of the string is interpreted later as a
     * regular expression. Because the place where these expressions are
     * used are many times inside strings that are indeed inside strings
     * it would require {@code \\\\} instead of a single {@code \}.
     * (Every {@code \\} becomes {@code \} when the string is parsed and
     * string inside string is parsed twice so we end up drawing fences.
     *
     * <p>The remediation of this is that the regular expressions in the
     * application at lot of places are allowed to use a different
     * character instead of {@code |}. (It can be a multiple character
     * string, but the recommendation is to use a single character and
     * if possible that single character should be {@code ~} tilde.) The
     * character that can be used instead of a {@code \} is usually
     * defined in a snippet parameter named {@code escape}. The value of
     * this parameter is in the argument {@code escape}. If this
     * parameter is not null or zero length then all occurrences of this
     * character in the search string will be replaces with the
     * backslash character. That way a regular expression can be written
     * like {@code ~s(.*?)~s} instead of {@code \\\\s(.*?)\\\\s} to get
     * the final regular expression {@code \s(.*?)\s}.
     *
     * <p>If the string starts with a different character than it ends
     * with, if that character cannot be found in between and thus the
     * string cannot be split into two parts, or if the string is too
     * short (the minimum length is 3 as for {@code ///} that replaces
     * the empty string with empty string and it is useless anyway but
     * still okay) then the code will throw a {@link GeciException}.
     *
     * @param replaceString the string to split up
     * @param escape        the escape character (or string)
     * @param snippet       the snippet. this parameter is used to
     *                      construct meaningful exception pointing out
     *                      the name of te snippet where the malformed
     *                      replace string is
     * @param source        the source. This parameter is also used only
     *                      to create meaningful exceptions.
     * @return the array of the two parts, {@code part[0]} the search
     * regular expression and {@code part[1]} the replacement string
