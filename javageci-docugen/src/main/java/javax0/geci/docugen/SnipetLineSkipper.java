/** // snippet SnipetLineSkipper_doc
 *
 *  The `skip` functionality is implemented in the class `SnippetLineSkipper`. This generator can remove certain lines
 *  from a snippet that are denoted to be removed. Many times some code segment contains lines that are not necessarily
 *  in the documentation and may distract the reader from the important points of the code. For example you want to
 *  include a whole Java class into the documentation and you believe that the `import` statements are not that
 *  important. In such cases the snippet may contain some lines that the `SnippetLineSkipper` will recognize and remove
 *  the lines indicated. There are three different possibilities.
 *
 *  The first one is to signal the start and the end of the lines to be removed like
 *
 *         // skip
 *         import javax0.geci.annotations.Geci;
 *         import javax0.geci.api.CompoundParams;
 *         import javax0.geci.api.Segment;
 *         import javax0.geci.api.Source;
 *
 *         import java.util.ArrayList;
 *         import java.util.regex.Pattern;
 *         // skip end
 *
 * The skipper will remove the lines `// skip`, `// skip end` and also the lines between.
 *
 * The second possibility is to write
 *
 *         // skip N lines
 *
 * The number `N` has to be a positive decimal number and the following `N` lines plus the `// skip N lines` will also
 * be deleted.
 *
 * The third possibility is to write
 *
 *        // skip till regexp
 *
 * that will delete this line and all following lines until there is a line that matches the regular expression.
 *
 * The generator will work only for segments that has the configuration parameter `skip="do"` with non zero length string
 * value. There is only one configuration possibility. If the value of the `skip` parameter on the segment is `remove`
 * (a.k.a. the segment contains the `skip="remove"` parameter) then only the lines that are instructions for the line
 * skippings are removed. In any other cases the line removing is performed as described above.
 *
 * In the generator builder the regular expression patterns that match `skip`, `skip end` and so on are configurable.
 *
 *  // end snippet
