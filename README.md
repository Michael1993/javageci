# Java::Geci

Java Generate Code Inline

Java::Geci is a library for generating Java code. Code generation programs
implemented using Java::Geci can be executed to generate new source code
or modify existing Java source files. This way the programmer can use
meta programming to express code in a shorter and more expressive way
than it would be possible in pure Java.

The framework discovers the files that need generated code, provides
easy to use API to generate code and takes care of writing the generated
code into the source code. The code generating program should focus on
the actual code structure it wants to generate.

## When do you need Java::Geci?

There are several occasions when we need generated code. The simplest
such scenarios are also supported by IDEs (Eclipse, NetBeans,
IntelliJ). They can create setters, getters, constructors, `equals()`
and `hashCode()` methods in different ways. There are two major problems
with that solution.

* One is that the code generation is manual, and in case the developer
  forgets to re-generate the code after an influencing change the code
  becomes outdated.

* The other problem is that the code generation possibilities are not
  extendable. There is a limited set of code that the tools can generate
  and the developer cannot easily extend these possibilities. 

Java::Geci eliminates these two problems. It has an execution mode to
check if all code generation is up-to-date and this can be used as a
unit test. If the developer forgot to update some of the generated code
after the program effecting the generated code was changed, the test
will fail. (As a matter of fact the test also updates the generated
code, you only need to start the build phase again.)

Java::Geci also has an extremely simple API supporting code generators
so it is extremely simple to create new code generators that are project
specific. You do not even need to package your code generator classes.
Just put them into some of the test packages and execute Java::Geci
during the test phase of the build process.

Java::Geci already includes several readily available code generators.
These are packaged with the core package and can generate

* setter and getter
* delegation methods (under development)
* fluent API classes and interfaces
* others will be under development

## How to use Java::Geci

Include the Java::Geci modules that you want to use in your project.
To do that with maven use the following dependencies:

```xml
<dependency>
    <!-- This is optional, you can use your own annotations or comment config -->
    <groupId>com.javax0.geci</groupId>
    <artifactId>javageci-annotation</artifactId>
    <version>1.2.0</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>com.javax0.geci</groupId>
    <artifactId>javageci-engine</artifactId>
    <scope>test</scope>
    <version>1.2.0</version>
</dependency>
```

This documentation contains the latest development version. For release
versions you can use see the latest non-SNAPSHOT version in the [release
history documentation](RELEASE.md).

There are other modules, but you do not need to declare dependency on
them as the engine module has transitive dependency and thus maven
automatically will use them. Since Java::Geci works during test
execution the dependencies have test scope. The exception is the
annotation module. This module defines an annotation that can be used to
configure the code generation during test time. Because of that the
retention of this module is run-time. Although the annotation is not
used in production but it remains in the byte code and thus is has to be
the default maven scope.

If for any reason production dependency must not include Java::Geci you
can configure some of the generators using comments or you can use your
own annotation interfaces that you can define inside your project.
Simply copy the `Geci.java` and `Gecis.java` to your project into any of
your packages and Java::Geci will recognize that they are to configure a
generator.

If you look at the test code `TestAccessor.java` in the test module you
can see that this is a proof of concept demonstration sample code:

<!-- snip TestAccessor -->
```java
    @Test
    public void testAccessor() throws Exception {
        Geci geci;
        Assertions.assertFalse(
                (geci = new Geci()).source(maven().module("javageci-examples").mainSource())
                        .register(Accessor.builder().build())
                        .generate(),
                geci.failed());
    }
```

The test runs during the build process and it generates files if that is
needed. If files were generated it means that the code was not up to
date and a new compilation has to be done. In this case the
`Assertions.fail()` will be invoked and you have to start the build
process again. Second time the code generation will recognize that the
code it could generate is already there and the process will not fail.
